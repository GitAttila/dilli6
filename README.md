# DILLI6 website

Prerequisites:
Globall installs of 'node.js' and 'gulp.js'.

After cloning or copying the project from the git repo, run the following commands in the terminal:

1. npm install
2. gulp build
3. gulp watch

The final project ready to be deployed on a server can be found within the 'dist' folder(after 'gulp build' was run).

4. gulp preview

...runs preview server on dist folder, so the project can be finally checked before being deployed on the server.
